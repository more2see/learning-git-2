	<h1>I against I</h1>
	<h4>Maybe Tomorrow</h4>
	<p>Maybe today i will finally find 
The handful of words that bring peace of mind 
'Cause yesterday left me with nothing at all 
I can't change a thing i'm feeling so small... </p>
	<br>
	<p>[Chorus] 
But as i'm waiting, i'm winning my chances are passing me by 
And as i'm waiting, i'm losing the spirit to get up and try 
Another day ends and i sit around by myself thinking "Life doesn't rhyme." 
Maybe tomorrow won't be here in time....
